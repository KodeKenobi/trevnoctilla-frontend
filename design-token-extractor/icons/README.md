# Icons Setup

## Quick Setup

1. Open `generate-icons.html` in your browser (from the parent directory)
2. Click "Download All Icons"
3. Move the downloaded PNG files to this `icons` folder

## Required Files

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels
- `icon32.png` - 32x32 pixels
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels

## Alternative: Use Placeholder Icons

If you just want to test the extension quickly, you can create simple colored squares:

1. Create 4 PNG files with the sizes above
2. Fill them with a solid color (e.g., #667eea)
3. Save them with the correct names in this folder

The extension will work with any icons - you can replace them with better designs later!
