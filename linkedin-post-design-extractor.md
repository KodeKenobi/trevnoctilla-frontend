# LinkedIn Post - Design Extractor Extension Launch

🎉 **Just launched Design Extractor - a Chrome extension with a game-changing Live Editor feature.**

Click any element on any website → view its styles in a sidebar → edit typography, colors, and spacing in real-time → copy the CSS. No dev tools needed.

**🎨 Live Editor (The Selling Point):**

- Click any element to select it (visual highlight with outline)
- View all computed styles in a sidebar panel
- Actually edit the element's inline styles in real-time:
  • Typography: font-family, font-size, font-weight, line-height, text color
  • Colors: background color and border color (with color picker)
  • Spacing: padding and margin values
- Changes are applied instantly via `element.style.property = value`
- Copy complete CSS for any edited element
- Reset button removes all inline style changes to restore original styles

**Plus automatic design token extraction:**
✨ Extracts colors (background, text, border) with visual swatches
📏 Identifies all spacing values (margins, padding, gaps)
🔤 Captures typography (font families, sizes, weights, line heights)
📦 Export in 4 formats: JSON, CSS variables, TypeScript, Tailwind config
🔒 100% local processing - no data leaves your browser
